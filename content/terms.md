## Educational Purpose Only

The Sunday Blender is provided for **educational purposes only**. All content published on this website is intended to spark curiosity and learning in young readers, but should not be regarded as verified facts or authoritative news reporting.

## AI-Assisted Content

We rely on artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) to summarize and curate news content. While we make every effort to cross-check information across multiple AI models and multiple news sources, we acknowledge the following limitations:

- **Not all details can be verified**: It would be impossible to validate every detail, figure, and statistic in every story we publish.
- **AI limitations**: LLMs may occasionally produce inaccurate or incomplete information.
- **Summaries, not original reporting**: Our content consists of summaries and curations of news from various sources, not original investigative journalism.

## No Guarantee of Accuracy

While we strive for accuracy and quality:

- We do **not guarantee** the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of any information published.
- Information should be used as a starting point for learning and discussion, not as definitive facts.
- We encourage readers to consult multiple sources for important topics.

## Parental Guidance

Parents and educators should:

- Review content with children to provide context and clarification
- Use articles as conversation starters rather than sole sources of information
- Encourage critical thinking and fact-checking skills
- Verify important information through additional reputable sources

## Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of The Sunday Blender constitutes acceptance of any changes.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about our content or these terms, please reach out through our contact channels.
