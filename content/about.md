## What is this?

The Sunday Blender is a weekly newsletter that reports top trending news around the world. It's made for curious English-speaking kids aged 8~15 who aspire for a bigger world and nurture a life-long habit of reading. Every new issue is delivered to your email inbox on Saturday. At present, this newsletter is free.

## Out of Scope

This newsletter does NOT work for kids who like to:

- watch an endless feed of short videos
- indulge in non-stop video-gaming
- limit his/her English proficiency only to a rudimentary level

## Why do this?

Because we love the smell of flipping through a freshly printed newspaper on Sunday morning. 

Our nine-year-old boy studies in a bilingual school in **Shanghai, China**. About a year ago, he started becoming curious about current affairs outside the school. We went on a mission to find quality English (or Chinese, for that matter) news-reading materials for him. We searched high and low and could not find any that would meet our standards.

News used to be simple and easy. The Economist used to just give you the download needed for the day, but not anymore. Nowadays, from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, BBC, NPR, Associated Press, Bloomberg, to The Guardian, they are all too biased with too many ideological lenses imposed. It is very hard to find a media outlet that can still serve balanced views and try to preserve human stories in their raw spirit.

Or, their contents are just too childish - OMG! A bear jumps out of the woods! They tend to grossly underestimate how smart the kids of today are.

Or, they still live in their own echo chambers with little coverage of China (Western media lost that capability long ago). Major topics in technology and the economy are increasingly shaped by AI and energy. If they cannot grasp what's happening in China on these fronts, they're missing half the picture.

So we figured we might as well take things into our own hands and create a newsletter for our son and his many little buddies. AI has become an extremely powerful tool to automate this laborious workflow of sourcing news, curating stories, and editing texts/pictures. I've used all the major LLMs (large language models) in this endeavor. My current favorite is **[claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)**. Its summation strikes the right tone and information density, better than **chatGPT**, **Gemini**, **Grok**, and definitely **DeepSeek**.

Our boy has been a big fan of The Sunday Blender, so is his friends at school. We find it an intellectually joyful process to compose each issue as we catch up with the world after a week of busy working and living.
