## What is this?

The Sunday Blender is a weekly newsletter that reports top trending news around the world in the last seven days. It includes several columns such as Tech, Global, Economy & Finance, Science, Nature & Environment, Entertainment & Culture, Sports, and Funny. Its new issue is scheduled for delivery by mid-night Saturday.

## Who is this for?

It is for curious kids in elementary school.

## Why do this?

My wife and I have an eight-year old boy, studying in a bilingual school in Shanghai, China. He is becoming increasingly curious about the bigger world outside the school and wants to stay current to the major events happening around the globe. We went on a mission to find quality English (or Chinese) news reading materials for him. We searched high and low for more than a year, and could not find any.

News used to be simple and easy. The Economist used to just give you the download you need but not any more. Nowadays, from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, BBC, NPR, Associated Press, Bloomberg to the Guardian, they are all too biased with too many ideological lens imposed. It is very hard to find a media outlet that can serve balanced views and try to preserve human stories in their raw form.

Also, it is not easy to find the right format for such a news service. Many Youtubers produce excellent news for adults but not for kids. We don't want our kid to watch videos either. Podcast has become a major source of news for us in the last 10 years but all the Fridmans, Ferrisses, and Rogans are getting longer and longer with episodes running up to 3 hours routinely. It is getting out of control, even for us.

So we figured we might as well take things into our own hands and create a newsletter for our son and his many little buddies. AI is becoming a very powerful tool to automate this laborious workflow of sourcing news, curating stories and editing texts/pictures. I use chatGPT and DeepSeek to get the top trending news in tech, economy, culture, science, sports, etc; compare their results and pick the ones that resonate with me.

Our son liked the first issue very much. We hope you, or your son/daughter would enjoy this series too. We find it an intellectually joyful process to compose each issue as we catch up with the world after a week of busy working and living.

## What We Cover

- **Technology** - Latest innovations and breakthroughs

## How You Can Contribute

- Leave your **comments** under the posts and share your thoughts with the broader community, who could benefit from your perspectives
- Send me news **stories** from your city/region that you would like to share with my son and many other kids. I can use your help building up a growing source library of notable news around the world leading up to every Saturday, on top of what chatGPT/Claude/DeepSeek can give me.
