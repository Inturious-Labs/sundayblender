# Subscribe

If you like The Sunday Blender, it would be a big help if you could subscribe with a monthly or annual plan. I plan to provide exclusive **premium content** to paid subscribers in the coming months. Despite of LLMs' help, it still takes a few hours each week to source, curate, and edit the new issue, to make sure the stories are interesting and age-appropriate for the kids. Your contribution gives me the confidence that this is a worthwhile endeavour. Thank you!
