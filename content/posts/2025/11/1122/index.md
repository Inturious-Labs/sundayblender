## Editor's Words

Podcast is now available on Apple Podcast, Spotify and Xiaoyuzhou, thanks to Google NotebookLM

It's now an open-source project on Github.


## Tech

On November 18, 2025, **Cloudflare** experienced a major global outage that knocked numerous high-profile websites offline. Roughly one-fifth of webpages and a third of the world's `10,000` most popular websites were affected, including **X**, **ChatGPT**, **Spotify**, **Zoom**, and **Coinbase**. The root cause was an automatically generated configuration file for managing threat traffic that grew beyond expected size, triggering crashes in traffic-handling software. The incident highlighted the fragility of internet infrastructure, where a single point of failure at one company can cascade across vast portions of the web, disrupting businesses and services worldwide.

**Google** released **Gemini 3** on November 18, 2025, after weeks of social media hype, with early leaked benchmarks sparking excitement among developers. Testing shows it outperforms **OpenAI**'s **GPT-5.1** and **Anthropic**'s **Claude Sonnet 4.5** on key benchmarks. Gemini 3 introduces "generative interfaces" that create visual layouts and dynamic views instead of plain text responses, with developers praising its ability to intuitively understand coding intent and fill in gaps without explicit instructions. In head-to-head coding tests, Gemini excelled at rapid prototyping, adding features like keyboard controls unprompted. The release came just six days after OpenAI's GPT-5.1 update, intensifying AI competition. However, Claude 4.5 maintains advantages in code debugging, while GPT-5.1 offers better cost efficiency. The rapid-fire releases have created "integration fatigue" among developers.

**Elon Musk** and **Jensen Huang** spoke at the US-Saudi Investment Forum on November 19, 2025, at Washington's Kennedy Center, discussing AI's future and announcing plans to build a `500-megawatt` AI factory in the Saudi desert equipped with **Nvidia** GPUs. Musk predicted work would become "optional" within 10-20 years, claiming AI and humanoid robots would eliminate poverty, while he also suggested money would eventually become irrelevant. Huang countered that AI would actually make people busier in the near term, citing radiologists who became more productive rather than unemployed. Musk also proposed space-based AI computing using solar power and zero-gravity cooling as the future solution to energy constraints. Huang jokingly asked Musk for advance warning before currency becomes irrelevant.

The November 2025 **TIOBE** index shows **Python** maintaining dominance at `23.37%`, representing a 9.3% annual growth that earned it 2024's "Programming Language of the Year" award. Python's lead stems from its central role in AI, machine learning, data science, and automation, powered by frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen notes Python has plateaued recently after years of unprecedented growth. Meanwhile, **Rust** sits at eighth place with 1.98%, gaining recognition as the top secure language adopted by **Microsoft**, **Google**, and **AWS**, with government agencies like **NSA** and **CISA** pushing memory-safe languages including Rust for critical infrastructure. Rust has been rising through 2024 and could reach the top 10 soon.

Chinese astronauts aboard the **Tiangong** space station achieved a first by using a new hot air oven to cook food in orbit in early November 2025. The Shenzhou-21 crew cooked marinated chicken wings and black pepper steaks, with the wings taking approximately `28` minutes to bake. The upgraded oven reaches `190` degrees Celsius, enabling genuine cooking with chemical reactions rather than just reheating, using high-temperature catalysis and multi-layer filtration for smoke-free, oil-free baking. Experts note hot meals help keep crews psychologically grounded during long missions. The device is rated for 500 uses, significantly exceeding earlier ISS demonstrations, marking an important advancement for sustaining astronauts on extended deep-space missions where fresh food preparation becomes crucial for crew morale and nutrition.

**Blue Origin** successfully launched its **New Glenn** rocket on November 13, 2025, marking its second flight, carrying **NASA**'s ESCAPADE mission—twin spacecraft that will study how Mars lost its atmosphere. The `320`-foot-tall rocket is powered by seven BE-4 engines generating over `3.8 million` pounds of thrust. Crucially, Blue Origin successfully landed the first-stage booster on its seafaring platform Jacklyn for the first time, after the booster exploded during the inaugural launch attempt in January. This achievement makes Blue Origin only the second company in history to recover a rocket during an operational flight, positioning the company to compete with **SpaceX**'s dominant market position. Even SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell congratulated Blue Origin, calling it "Magnificent".

Beijing's **Yitu School**, founded in 2016 by former **McKinsey** partner and **Gates Foundation** China head **Li Yinuo**, recently "imploded" amid financial crisis. In November 2025, Li revealed the school couldn't pay teachers' salaries starting October, with her co-founder borrowing personally to cover half of October's wages. Li blamed their partner school Zhizhi for borrowing over `50 million` yuan using the school's cash flow as collateral, then diverting funds to related companies. Li admitted "poor management capability" led to the crisis and acknowledged pursuing legal action to recover misappropriated funds. Once dubbed the "pioneer of innovative schools",  Yitu attracted elite families with its slogan of cultivating "children with fulfilled hearts", but faced teacher layoffs, management chaos, and enrollment losses.

**Tom Cruise** received his first **Oscar** - an honorary Academy Award—at the Governors Awards on November 16, 2025, recognizing his unwavering commitment to filmmaking, vital support of the theatrical experience, and unmatched body of work. Cruise's films have grossed over `$11 billion` worldwide as lead actor, with box office hits spanning four decades since the late 1980s, making him one of Hollywood's most bankable stars. From his 1986 breakthrough with **Top Gun**—the year's highest-grossing film—through the **Mission: Impossible** franchise he's led since 1996, to 2022's **Top Gun: Maverick** earning over `$1.4 billion`, Cruise remains Hollywood's last true action superstar. Presenter director **Alejandro González Iñárritu** declared "Tom Cruise doesn't just make movies, he is movies". In his emotional speech, Cruise humbly celebrated fellow honorees before paying tribute to cinema's unifying power.

Nintendo released the first official set photos from the live-action Legend of Zelda movie on November 17, 2025, showing Link and Zelda in full costume against New Zealand's lush landscapes. The images sparked an overwhelming fan frenzy, with reaction videos, comment threads, and social posts filled with excitement as longtime fans said seeing the characters in live action made the project "feel real for the first time". Fans praised the costume accuracy and applauded details like the pointed Hylian ears, relieved Hollywood wouldn't tone down fantasy elements. Social media immediately lit up with reactions about how faithful the adaptation appears, with fans expressing they're "already hyped" while questioning whether it can capture the games' magic without feeling "too Hollywood". The hashtag #ZeldaMovieCasting trended for hours, with some fans declaring they'd "been waiting 20 years for a Zelda movie", though cautious viewers remain nervous about Hollywood's involvement with the beloved franchise.

**Call of Duty: Black Ops 7** sparked controversy at launch over AI-generated calling cards featuring Studio **Ghibli**-style artwork that players deemed "AI slop". **Activision** confirmed via Steam disclosure that it uses "generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets," after players spotted telltale signs like a zombie Santa with six fingers. The backlash was severe enough that some players secured **Steam** refunds, with one completing the entire campaign before citing undisclosed AI content. **Reddit** users expressed frustration at being fed AI content in a full-price AAA title already packed with microtransactions. The controversy drew political attention when US Congressman Ro Khanna called for regulations preventing companies from using AI to eliminate creative jobs. Black Ops 7 plummeted to a `1.7/10` **Metacritic** user score, the lowest in franchise history.

A silver titanium **Speedwell** bicycle ridden by German electronic band **Kraftwerk**'s Florian Schneider in the 1984 "**Tour de France**" music video recently sold at auction for `$57,600`—over `14` times its initial estimate. The 1983 electronic anthem became synonymous with cycling culture, serving as Channel 4's theme music for UK Tour de France broadcasts, cementing its status as the race's unofficial soundtrack. The innovative track used sampled cycling sounds like chain rattles and gear shifts, becoming a blueprint for later techno and house genres while positioning itself as a timeless electronic sports anthem. Kraftwerk's celebration captured the race's spirit through hypnotic rhythms mirroring cycling's mechanical nature, with references to mountains, valleys, and the coveted yellow jersey. The band released a full album for the race's 100th anniversary in 2003, which became their first number-one album in Germany.

**David Szalay** won the **2025 Booker Prize** on November 10 for his sixth novel, **Flesh**, becoming the first Hungarian-British author to win the award. The Booker Prize is regarded as one of the most prestigious literary awards in the world, with winners receiving `£50,000` and international publicity that usually leads to significant sales boosts. The spare, propulsive novel follows protagonist István from adolescence to old age through events beyond his control. Judging panel chair Roddy Doyle said judges kept returning to Flesh "because of its singularity," noting they'd "never read anything quite like it". Szalay wanted to explore Europe's cultural divides while writing "about life as a physical experience, about what it's like to be a living body". This was his second Booker nomination.
