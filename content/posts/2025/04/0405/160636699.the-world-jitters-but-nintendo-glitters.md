**April Fool’s Day**, celebrated on **April 1st**, is a lighthearted tradition where people play pranks and jokes on each other. Its origins are uncertain, but it may date back to the 16th century when France switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. Those who continued to celebrate New Year’s in late March were mocked as “April fools.” Today, it’s a global day of playful deception, from harmless personal tricks to elaborate hoaxes by media and corporations. While mostly fun, the spirit of the day relies on good humor and keeping pranks clever, not cruel. Laughter is the ultimate goal.

On **April 5, 1614**, **Pocahontas**, daughter of **Powhatan** chief Wahunsenacawh, married English tobacco planter **John Rolfe** in Jamestown, Virginia. Their union marked a rare moment of peace between English settlers and Native Americans, known as the “Peace of Pocahontas.” Pocahontas converted to Christianity, taking the name Rebecca. The marriage was seen by the English as a symbol of potential harmony and assimilation. Her story became mythologized over time, often romanticized, yet it remains a complex symbol of cultural encounter, colonization, and indigenous resilience.

​An American is making a sandwich and realizes he's out of ketchup. He asks his Chinese roommate, "Do we have any condiments?" The roommate replies, "Mayo." So, the American eats his sandwich plain. How come?

Turns out his roommate wasn’t offering **mayonnaise**. He was saying "méiyǒu" (没有), which means "**no**" in Chinese.
