As of March 15, 2025, **NASA** **(National Aeronautics and Space Administration)**'s **SpaceX** Crew-10 mission is en route to the International Space Station (ISS). The Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft launched successfully from **Kennedy Space Center** on March 14 at 7:03 p.m. EDT. The spacecraft is scheduled to autonomously dock with the ISS at approximately 11:30 p.m. EDT on March 15. This mission is particularly significant as it facilitates the return of NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been aboard the ISS since June 2024 due to technical issues with **Boeing**'s Starliner spacecraft.

**Manus AI**, launched on March 6, 2025, by Chinese startup Monica, is being hailed as the world’s first fully autonomous AI agent. Unlike traditional chatbots, Manus independently plans and executes complex tasks such as creating websites, analyzing stocks, and managing enterprise data. Co-founder Yichao "Peak" Ji describes it as a step toward artificial general intelligence (**AGI**), bridging human-machine collaboration. While praised for its groundbreaking capabilities, early users report glitches and performance inconsistencies. Accessible only by invitation, Manus has sparked global interest and concern, with experts warning it may disrupt labor markets by industrializing intelligence and automating decision-making processes.

In an effort to revitalize tourism, **Hong Kong** has launched a "Let's Go the Extra Mile" campaign, encouraging service workers, including taxi drivers, to exhibit greater courtesy and helpfulness. Chief Executive John Lee emphasized the importance of smiling and improved service to attract visitors. The campaign aims to address past criticisms of poor service that have tarnished Hong Kong's image. Despite these efforts, tourism numbers, particularly from mainland China, have not fully rebounded, with some visitors preferring destinations in southern China due to better service and lower costs.

In 2024, **New Zealand** experienced a significant emigration surge, with **127,800** people departing—a **28%** increase from the previous year. This trend is primarily attributed to economic challenges, including a technical recession marked by the highest recession rate since 1991 (excluding the pandemic), declining productivity, and high unemployment rates. Consequently, many New Zealanders are seeking better opportunities abroad, particularly in **Australia**, which boasts a stronger economy and lower unemployment.

Gold prices have surged to an unprecedented **$3,000** per ounce, driven by heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Central banks have significantly increased gold purchases, diversifying reserves to mitigate risks associated with foreign currencies. The ongoing trade disputes, particularly U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures from other nations, have fueled investor anxiety, pushing gold prices up by **14%** since the start of 2025. As global economic instability persists, gold is expected to remain a favored asset, potentially driving prices even higher in the coming months

In February 2025, Chinese mathematician **Hong Wang**, an associate professor at **NYU**'s Courant Institute, alongside **Joshua Zahl** from the **University of British Columbia**, resolved the longstanding Kakeya conjecture in three dimensions. The Kakeya problem, posed in 1917 by Sōichi Kakeya, inquires about the minimal area required to rotate a needle in all directions within a plane. Wang and Zahl demonstrated that while such sets can have zero volume, they must still be three-dimensional. This breakthrough not only advances geometric measure theory but also positions Wang as a strong contender for the Fields Medal, one of mathematics' highest honors.

The European Space Agency’s **Odysseus** rover has begun operations on the Moon, exploring its surface for geological insights. Meanwhile, Japan’s Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (**SLIM**), nicknamed "Moon Sniper," has been reactivated after surviving extreme lunar conditions. SLIM, which landed in January 2024 near the Shioli crater, demonstrated precision landing technology but faced issues with solar power due to its tilted position. Both missions exemplify advancements in lunar exploration, with Odysseus focusing on scientific discovery and SLIM showcasing innovative landing techniques for future missions.

​In 2025, Daylight Saving Time (DST) in the United States began on **Sunday, March 9**, when clocks were set forward one hour at 2:00 a.m. local time. DST will end on **Sunday, November 2**, at 2:00 a.m., when clocks will be set back one hour to standard time. This practice, commonly referred to as "spring forward" in March and "fall back" in November, is observed by most U.S. states. The primary purpose of DST is to make better use of daylight during the longer days of summer, providing extended evening daylight. However, the practice has been a topic of debate, with discussions about its impact on health and energy consumption.

The **James Webb Space Telescope** has captured images of brown dwarfs in the Flame Nebula, objects too small to be stars but larger than planets. These free-floating objects have masses as low as two to three times **Jupiter**'s. Webb's infrared capabilities allow it to detect these faint, low-mass objects previously hidden in dense star-forming regions. This research helps scientists understand the mass limitations of brown dwarfs and distinguish them from rogue planets. Webb's giant mirror and infrared view provide unprecedented insights into the cosmos, revealing previously unseen objects and revolutionizing our understanding of the universe.

In the early hours of March 14, 2025, skywatchers across **Chile**, **Argentina**, and **Venezuela** gathered to witness a total lunar eclipse, popularly known as a "blood moon." This celestial event occurs when the Earth aligns directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the moon a reddish hue. In Chile, the eclipse began at 3:26 a.m., reached its maximum at 3:58 a.m., and concluded by 4:31 a.m., offering a spectacular display visible nationwide. The next opportunity to experience a total lunar eclipse in these regions will be in June 2029, making this event particularly special for enthusiasts and casual observers alike.

**​London**'s local news landscape has significantly declined, transforming the city into a "news desert." The **Evening Standard**, once the last daily paper, transitioned to a weekly format, leaving a void in daily local coverage. This decline mirrors a broader trend in the UK, where over **300** local newspapers closed between 2009 and 2019, leading to reduced resources for remaining outlets. In response, a mix of small news sources and digital platforms has emerged, striving to fill the gap. However, these new entities often struggle with sustainability and reach, raising concerns about the future of local journalism and its role in maintaining informed communities. ​

In March 2025, **Denmark**'s state-run postal service, **PostNord**, announced it would cease letter deliveries by the end of the year, ending a **400-year** tradition. This decision stems from a dramatic **90%** decline in letter volumes since 2000, attributed to increased digital communication. Consequently, PostNord plans to remove approximately **1,500** mailboxes starting in June and lay off about **1,500** of its **4,600** employees. This move reflects broader challenges faced by postal services globally as digitalization reduces traditional mail usage.
