Japan's rice prices hit historic highs in early 2025, with a **70.7%** year-on-year surge in January, following a **64.5%** increase in December 2024—the largest jumps since record-keeping began in 1971. This spike stems from a convergence of factors: yen depreciation inflating import costs, extreme weather (e.g., 2024 heatwaves and earthquakes) reducing domestic yields, and rising production costs (fertilizer, labor, logistics). Japan’s low food self-sufficiency rate (**35%**) exacerbates reliance on imports, while agricultural cooperatives prioritize cultural preservation over efficiency, stifling modernization.

**China**’s Zhurong rover has uncovered compelling evidence of ancient water activity in the Utopia Planitia region, reinforcing the hypothesis that Mars once hosted a vast ocean. Using its dual-frequency ground-penetrating radar, Zhurong detected **76** subsurface sedimentary layers at depths of **10–35 meters**. These structures closely resemble Earth’s coastal sediment layers formed by tidal currents, suggesting a stable, long-term marine environment in Mars’ northern lowlands billions of years ago. These findings not only advance understanding of Mars’ climatic evolution but also highlight the region’s potential for subsurface ice—a critical resource for future human missions.

Jimmie Johnson's performance at the 2025 Daytona 500 was a highlight of the event. Johnson, a seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion and two-time Daytona 500 winner, finished third in the race. This marked his best finish since his victory in 2013 and his first top-three finish in the NextGen car era. Johnson surged from 15th place with one lap remaining, navigating through a late-race wreck to secure his podium spot. Johnson's car was partially backed by NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, who designed the vehicle after winning a free-throw competition.
