**Ukrainian** President **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** abruptly left the White House after a contentious meeting with **President Donald Trump**. The Oval Office encounter devolved into a shouting match, with Trump and Vice President **JD Vance** criticizing Zelenskyy for his handling of the conflict with Russia. Trump accused Zelenskyy of being "disrespectful" and not appreciative of U.S. support. The meeting was intended to finalize a minerals agreement, but it ended without signatures. Trump threatened to cut off U.S. support if Ukraine does not make concessions, further straining relations between the two nations.

The U.S. plans to launch a **$5 million** "gold card" visa, replacing the EB-5 program. This new visa offers permanent residency and a path to citizenship for affluent investors.

The initiative is part of a global trend to enhance visa programs for investment.

A massive power outage struck **Chile** on February 25, 2025, affecting over **90%** of the population. The blackout was caused by a failure in a high-voltage transmission line that delivers electricity from the Atacama Desert in northern Chile to the capital, **Santiago**. This critical infrastructure failure led to widespread disruptions across 14 of Chile's 16 regions, impacting crucial services like transportation, mining, and communication networks.

Japan's rice prices hit historic highs in early 2025, with a **70.7%** year-on-year surge in January, following a **64.5%** increase in December 2024—the largest jumps since record-keeping began in 1971. This spike stems from a convergence of factors: yen depreciation inflating import costs, extreme weather (e.g., 2024 heatwaves and earthquakes) reducing domestic yields, and rising production costs (fertilizer, labor, logistics). Japan’s low food self-sufficiency rate (**35%**) exacerbates reliance on imports, while agricultural cooperatives prioritize cultural preservation over efficiency, stifling modernization.

**Hong Kong**'s government has implemented a salary freeze for public servants, including the chief executive, judges, and lawmakers, as part of its 2025 budget measures. This freeze aims to address the city's significant budget deficit, estimated at **HK$87.2 billion**. Additionally, about **10,000** civil service positions will be eliminated by April 2027. The measures are designed to reduce expenditure while maintaining public service quality. .

**China**’s Zhurong rover has uncovered compelling evidence of ancient water activity in the Utopia Planitia region, reinforcing the hypothesis that Mars once hosted a vast ocean. Using its dual-frequency ground-penetrating radar, Zhurong detected **76** subsurface sedimentary layers at depths of **10–35 meters**. These structures closely resemble Earth’s coastal sediment layers formed by tidal currents, suggesting a stable, long-term marine environment in Mars’ northern lowlands billions of years ago. These findings not only advance understanding of Mars’ climatic evolution but also highlight the region’s potential for subsurface ice—a critical resource for future human missions.
