On March 6, 2025, **SpaceX**’s Starship exploded during its eighth test flight, just minutes after launching from Boca Chica, Texas. The **403-foot** rocket, the most powerful ever built, successfully separated its Super Heavy booster, which returned to the launchpad as planned. However, the upper stage spun out of control, losing several engines due to an "energetic event" in its aft section, leading to a "rapid unscheduled disassembly." Debris rained over the Caribbean, disrupting **240** flights and prompting ground stops at Florida airports. The FAA is now investigating, marking SpaceX’s second consecutive Starship failure this year.

**Intuitive Machines**' stock plummeted by **22%** after its second lunar lander, Athena, landed on its side, mirroring the fate of its predecessor, Odysseus.
