On March 6, 2025, **SpaceX**’s Starship exploded during its eighth test flight, just minutes after launching from Boca Chica, Texas. The **403-foot** rocket, the most powerful ever built, successfully separated its Super Heavy booster, which returned to the launchpad as planned. However, the upper stage spun out of control, losing several engines due to an "energetic event" in its aft section, leading to a "rapid unscheduled disassembly." Debris rained over the Caribbean, disrupting **240** flights and prompting ground stops at Florida airports. The FAA is now investigating, marking SpaceX’s second consecutive Starship failure this year.

**Intuitive Machines**' stock plummeted by **22%** after its second lunar lander, Athena, landed on its side, mirroring the fate of its predecessor, Odysseus. The lander, part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, tipped over in a crater near the moon's south pole, preventing it from recharging its batteries due to the sun's position and extreme cold. Despite gathering some data, the mission was cut short, raising concerns about the company's designs and NASA's approach to lunar exploration.

On March 3, 2025, **Reddit** co-founder Alexis Ohanian joined billionaire **Frank McCourt**’s “People’s Bid” to acquire **TikTok**’s U.S. operations as a strategic adviser. Announced by McCourt’s Project Liberty, the bid aims to buy the app from ByteDance amid a U.S. divest-or-ban law. Ohanian, a social media pioneer, plans to integrate blockchain technology, creating a decentralized “TikTok: Freedom Edition” that prioritizes user data control. The consortium, including Kevin O’Leary, offered **$20 billion**, though TikTok’s value may exceed **$60 billion**. Facing a deadline extended to April by President Trump, the bid competes with groups like **Microsoft** and MrBeast’s consortium.

Wired reviewed the **We Are Rewind** cassette player, a modern take on vintage tape decks. Encased in sturdy aluminum, it offers great sound and USB-C recharging, outshining fragile vintage Walkmans. Bluetooth compatibility pairs with wireless headphones, though it lacks auto-stop on rewind, causing a motor squeal. At **14 ounces**, it’s hefty but reliable, avoiding tape damage over a year of testing. Ideal for cassette collectors, it balances nostalgia with modern convenience, despite a muted Bluetooth output. Priced competitively, it’s a top choice for tape enthusiasts seeking quality over thrift store relics.

On March 5, 2025, Chinese Premier Li Qiang vowed to boost spending and deepen global openness during the National People’s Congress, setting a **5%** growth target for 2025. Facing U.S. tariffs under President Trump’s isolationist policies, China plans a **4%** deficit-to-GDP ratio, up from **3%**, and will issue **1.3 trillion** yuan (**$182 billion**) in special treasury bonds. Li emphasized multilateralism, rejecting protectionism, and pledged to expand market access, particularly in telecom and biotech, to attract foreign investment. This contrasts with Trump’s tariff hikes, aiming to counter economic slowdown and reinforce China’s role as a global economic stabilizer.

​During the first round of the Cognizant Classic at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, professional golfer Billy Horschel encountered an unexpected hazard—a six-foot alligator on the course. Horschel calmly used a 60-degree wedge to gently prod the gator, guiding it back to the water without incident. This impromptu intervention earned him applause from spectators and accolades on social media, with some dubbing him the "gator whisperer." Horschel downplayed the encounter, noting that alligators are typically more afraid of humans and usually pose little threat unless during mating season or when protecting their nests. Despite the unusual interruption, Horschel maintained his composure, finishing the round with a five-under-par 66, positioning him well in the tournament standings.
