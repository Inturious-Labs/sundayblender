​**NASA** astronauts **Butch Wilmore** and **Suni Williams** safely returned to Earth after an unexpected **286-day** mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Originally slated for a brief stay, their mission was extended due to propulsion issues with their initial **Boeing** spacecraft. **SpaceX**'s **Crew-9** mission facilitated their return, with the Dragon capsule successfully splashing down near Tallahassee, Florida. Upon landing, the capsule was surrounded by dolphins, adding a unique touch to their homecoming. Post-mission, Wilmore and Williams will undergo rehabilitation to readjust to Earth's gravity after their prolonged stay in space.

As **Windows 10** approaches its end-of-support date on **October 14, 2025**, Microsoft has initiated efforts to transition users to **Windows 11**. Recent communications include emails encouraging users to upgrade their systems, with a notable suggestion to consider purchasing new PCs compatible with Windows 11. This recommendation stems from the fact that many older devices do not meet the stringent hardware requirements of Windows 11, making an upgrade infeasible without new hardware. However, this approach has faced criticism, as it may not be practical or affordable for all users to invest in new computers.

The **elephant bird** (_Aepyornis maximus_), native to Madagascar and extinct since at least the 17th century, laid the largest known eggs of any species. These eggs measured over a foot in length and nine inches in diameter, with a volume approximately **100** times that of a chicken egg. Adult elephant birds stood around **10 feet** tall and weighed over **1,000 pounds**, resembling oversized ostriches but closely related to New Zealand's kiwi. Their extinction is attributed to human activities, including hunting and habitat destruction. Remarkably, intact elephant bird eggs have been discovered far from Madagascar, such as on Western Australian beaches, having floated across the Indian Ocean.
