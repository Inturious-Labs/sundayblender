**DeepSeek**, a Chinese AI startup initially part of the hedge fund High-Flyer, has released an open-source model, *DeepSeek-R1*, that outperforms leading AI models from Western companies like OpenAI on several benchmarks, despite limited resources. DeepSeek refined their AI using software-driven resource optimization and innovative model architecture rather than relying on extensive hardware. By open-sourcing their model, DeepSeek fosters collaborative innovation crucial for their advancements, potentially challenging current US AI export limitations.

**Rubin Observatory** is a new telescope under construction in Chile, atop a mountain that is 2,682-meters (8,800-feet) tall. The telescope will catalogue billions of new objects and produce a new map of the entire night sky every three days with the largest digital camera ever made. By the end of the survey, this 3.2-gigapixel camera will have catalogued 20 billion galaxies and collected up to 60 petabytes of data—roughly three times the amount currently stored by the US Library of Congress.

**OpenAI** and **SoftBank** have announced a significant AI infrastructure project in the U.S. called **Stargate**, set to cost $100 billion initially, potentially increasing to $500 billion. This venture aims to build extensive data centers and virtual infrastructure to support the next generation of AI advancements, creating around 100,000 jobs immediately. It marks a close collaboration between SoftBank, OpenAI, and other tech giants like Microsoft and Nvidia.

**ByteDance**, the owner of TikTok, is planning to invest over $12 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. This move comes as ByteDance faces pressure from Washington to sell TikTok's US operations and amidst new US export controls limiting the availability of advanced AI chips to China. ByteDance aims to buy 60% of its domestic AI chips from Chinese suppliers like Huawei and Cambricon. This substantial investment aims to bolster ByteDance's AI capabilities, especially for its chatbot Doubao, amid strong competition from Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.

**OpenAI** released **Operator**, an AI agent designed to automate web-based tasks such as booking flights, filling forms, and managing expenses through a browser. Currently in a U.S.-only research preview for ChatGPT Pro users, Operator leverages GPT-4o's vision and reasoning capabilities to interact with apps like Uber and Instacart. While promising efficiency gains, early reviews note its reliance on human oversight for complex tasks. Critics warn of potential job displacement in sectors like customer service and administrative roles.

Google is investing an additional $1 billion in **Anthropic**, an OpenAI competitor known for its **Claude** family of AI models. This increases Google's total investment in Anthropic to $3 billion as part of its strategy to enhance its position in the AI sector and compete with major companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. Anthropic, which reached $1 billion in annual revenue in December, is also expected to secure $2 billion from other investors. Founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI employees, Anthropic distinguishes itself with a focus on AI safety and innovative AI capabilities, such as computer control.

Startup **Stegra** began constructing the world's first industrial-scale green steel plant in Sweden, using hydrogen produced via renewable energy. This initiative aims to cut CO₂ emissions from steel production, which currently surpasses India's total output. The project aligns with EU mandates for carbon-neutral heavy industries by 2030.

**Samsung** launched its latest AI-powered smartphone, the **S25**, in an attempt to challenge Apple's dominance in the US market. Despite a market share of 23% compared to Apple's 53%, Samsung is aiming to leverage its AI advancements to capture more market share. The S25 boasts improved performance with a 40% boost in neural processing, and enhanced integration with third-party apps like WhatsApp and Spotify. Samsung's S25 introduces a shift from traditional touchscreens to an AI voice assistant-driven experience.

**TikTok** resumed U.S. operations following a one-day ban after President Trump signed an order granting a 75-day reprieve. However, ByteDance-owned apps like CapCut and Marvel Snap faced disruptions, prompting competitors like Instagram to launch rival services (e.g., Edits). Legal uncertainty persists, with lawmakers debating forced divestiture or permanent bans. Analysts predict further volatility as Trump's administration weighs national security risks against economic interests.
