**Elon Musk** recently shared exciting updates about **Neuralink** during a June 2025 talk. He revealed that Neuralink is preparing to start human trials for vision-restoring implants within the next six months. These implants aim to help people who are completely blind by writing data directly to their visual cortex, allowing them to perceive sight again. Musk mentioned that one monkey has already had a visual implant for three years, showing promising results. Additionally, Neuralink now has seven human patients implanted with its brain-computer interface (BCI), mostly people with paralysis or ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), who can control computers using their thoughts. The company is also working on increasing the implant's electrode count from **1,000** to **3,000** in 2026, with plans to reach **10,000** channels by 2027 and over **25,000** by 2028. Future goals include multiple implants targeting different brain areas for speech, motor control, and vision, and integrating AI for advanced brain functions. The BCI technology is enabling humans to move from cursor control to brain-powered speech, vision, and eventually full neural-AI integration.

On June 22, 2025, **Tesla** took an exciting leap into the future by launching its first Robotaxi service in **Austin, Texas**.

In June 2025, seven **B-2** bombers flew from **Whiteman Air Force Base** in **Missouri, USA,** on a **37-hour** round-trip mission covering thousands of miles. The **B-2 Spirit** bomber is one of the most advanced planes ever built. It is known as a “stealth bomber” because its special shape and material make it almost invisible to radar. Its wings are shaped like a flying wing with no tail, which reduces drag and radar reflection. The plane is covered with radar-absorbing material, and even its engine air intakes are hidden to reduce heat signals. The B-2 can carry both nuclear and regular bombs, flying up to 11,000 km without refueling. Its controls are fly-by-wire, meaning a computer helps keep it stable because its shape alone would be hard to control. Only 21 were made, costing over **$2 billion** each. It is amazing how the B-2 combines aerodynamics, material science, stealth technology, and advanced computer systems into one aircraft.

**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC)**’s affiliate Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. (VIS) plans to speed up production at its new **$7.8 billion** chip factory in **Singapore**.

Excessive screen time is changing the brain in surprising and harmful ways. Research shows that adults **aged 18 to 25** who spend too much time on screens may experience thinning of the cerebral cortex, the brain’s outer layer responsible for memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. This can reduce concentration and cognitive ability. High screen use also leads to lower gray matter volume, which accelerates brain aging and affects memory and emotional control. Additionally, blue light from screens disrupts sleep by delaying melatonin production, harming cognitive performance and mood. Constantly checking phones right after waking can trigger stress responses, keeping the brain in a hyper-alert state. Long hours of screen use have been linked to increased risks of dementia, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. Experts recommend practical steps like the **20-20-20 rule**—looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes—taking regular breaks, limiting late-night screen use, and engaging in physical and social activities to protect brain health and improve focus.
