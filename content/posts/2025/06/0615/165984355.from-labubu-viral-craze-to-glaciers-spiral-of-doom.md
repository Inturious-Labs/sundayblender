**Apple**'s **WWDC 2025** (Worldwide Developers Conference), held June 9-13, received mixed feedback from the tech industry. The "Liquid Glass" design across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe was praised for its sleek, visionOS-inspired aesthetic, marking the biggest iOS redesign since 2013. However, the AI announcements, including Live Translation and **ChatGPT** integration, disappointed many. Analysts noted Apple’s Apple Intelligence updates lacked the innovation seen in **Google**’s and **Microsoft**’s AI rollouts, with delays in Siri’s AI overhaul until 2026 fueling perceptions of Apple lagging in the AI race.

**Meta** invested **$14.3 billion** for a **49%** stake in **Scale AI**, valuing the AI data-labeling company at over **$29 billion**. Scale AI’s CEO, **Alexandr Wang**, joined Meta to head a new “Superintelligence” AI lab, with some Scale employees following. Scale AI remains independent, led by interim CEO Jason Droege, and continues serving clients like **Microsoft** and **OpenAI**, though **Google** may reduce its reliance. The deal strengthens Meta’s AI capabilities, particularly for models like **Llama**, amid fierce competition. It also provides liquidity for Scale’s shareholders and avoids major antitrust issues.

At **VivaTech 2025** in **Paris**, **NVIDIA** CEO **Jensen Huang** sharply criticized **Anthropic** CEO **Dario Amodei**’s prediction that AI could eliminate **50%** of entry-level white-collar jobs within **five** years, potentially raising unemployment to **20%**. Huang dismissed Amodei’s claims as fear-mongering, arguing AI will transform jobs, not destroy them, and create new opportunities. He also challenged Amodei’s push for limited AI development, advocating for open, transparent innovation. The clash highlights contrasting visions for AI’s societal impact, with Huang optimistic and Amodei cautious.

On June 12, 2025, a **3.5-hour** **Google Cloud Platform** (GCP) outage exposed the risks of centralized cloud platforms. An invalid automated quota update at 12:15 PM ET disrupted BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Firebase, and App Engine, affecting third-party services like **Spotify**, **Discord**, **Cloudflare**, and **Snapchat**. Over **14,000** U.S. users reported issues, per **Downdetector**. Resolved by 3:49 PM ET, the incident highlighted how reliance on a single provider can cascade failures across interconnected services. Centralized clouds, while efficient, create single points of failure, raising concerns about systemic vulnerabilities and the need for decentralized or hybrid solutions.

**Blatten**, a once-idyllic **Swiss** village in the **Lötschental Valley**, renowned for its breathtaking alpine beauty and serene charm, was destroyed on May 28, 2025. The picturesque hamlet, nestled beneath the stunning **Birch Glacier**, was buried when the glacier collapsed, unleashing **10 million** cubic meters of ice, mud, and rock in a landslide. Evacuated on May 19 after signs of glacier instability, likely due to climate change-driven permafrost melt, the **300** residents escaped, but a 64-year-old man remains missing. The disaster, which blocked the **Lonza River** and caused flooding, erased a cherished Alpine gem.

**Navan**, formerly TripActions, is eyeing an IPO with an $8 billion valuation in late 2025, driven by its AI-powered platform revolutionizing corporate travel and expense management. Its success stems from integrating OpenAI’s tech, streamlining bookings, and automating expenses via tools like the Ava assistant. Acquisitions like **Tripeur** expanded its global reach, while fintech innovations, including corporate cards, fueled 100% annual growth. Navan’s rise reflects broader trends: businesses embracing AI for efficiency, a rebounding corporate travel sector post-pandemic, and a thriving IPO market for tech-driven firms.

Spacecraft the **Solar Orbiter** just captured the first images of the sun’s south pole, revealing its magnetic poles have flipped, a normal event in the sun’s 11-year solar cycle. The sun is **93 million** miles away in space. At the beginning and end of its weather cycle, flares and sunspots calm down. But solar activity rises before it falls, and when it climaxes, the sun roils with giant eruptions. While a normal magnet has clear north and south poles, both of the sun's poles occupy the bottom now. This happens only for a short period during "solar maximum" before a single polarity eventually takes over, and the entire magnetic field reorders itself in the reversed configuration.

A May 2025 **Guardian** article reported a study finding that nearly **40%** of the world’s glaciers are already doomed to melt due to past fossil fuel emissions, even if global warming stopped today. If current climate policies persist, leading to a **2.7°C** temperature rise, **75%** of glaciers could vanish, raising sea levels by **23cm** and threatening billions with water shortages and mass migration. Limiting warming to **1.5°C** could save half the ice, but rising emissions make this goal elusive. Every **0.1°C** avoided saves **2.7 trillion** tonnes of ice.

In May 2025, the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)** released a report predicting record-high global temperatures for 2025–2029, with an **86%** chance that at least one year will exceed **1.5°C** above pre-industrial levels and a **70%** chance the five-year average will surpass this threshold. Fueled by greenhouse gases and diminishing air pollution, these temperatures risk intensifying heatwaves, droughts, and floods. Arctic warming is expected to triple the global average, while precipitation shifts will bring wetter conditions to the **Sahel** in **Africa** and drier ones to the **Amazon**. Urgent climate action is needed to mitigate impacts.

​On **June 15, 1752**, **Benjamin Franklin** conducted his iconic kite experiment, flying a kite during a thunderstorm to prove lightning was electricity. He attached a metal key to the kite string, observing an electric spark when lightning struck, confirming the electrical nature of lightning. This groundbreaking experiment demonstrated that atmospheric electricity could be harnessed and studied, laying the foundation for advancements in electromagnetism. Franklin’s findings led to the invention of the lightning rod, which protects buildings from lightning strikes. His work influenced future electrical research, shaping modern physics and establishing electricity as a key scientific field.
