On June 5, 2025, the **Nintendo Switch 2** launched, igniting unprecedented demand. Priced at **$449.99**, it sold out instantly, with **2.2 million** pre-order applications in Japan alone, surpassing the original Switch’s **330,000** first-week sales there. Nintendo forecasts **15 million** units sold by **March 2026**, though analysts predict up to **20 million**, potentially making it the fastest-selling console ever.

China’s economic struggles have popularized the term “**involution**,” describing intense competition for scarce resources amid stagnation. Unlike past global economic terms like “secular stagnation,” involution captures China’s unique crisis: a property slump, cautious consumers, and overcapacity, as noted by **Geely**’s chairman halting new plants. Despite stimulus hopes, fiscal policies remain reactive, not transformative. Youth face diminishing returns from education and jobs, fueling social media laments. Economists warn this inward spiral could persist without bold reforms, as China grapples with a slowing economy and global trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs and export curbs.

**​**On June 3, 2025, Singapore’s financial authority (MAS) made a new rule: crypto companies in Singapore without a license must stop offering digital currency services to people outside the country by June 30, 2025. This is to prevent illegal activities like money laundering. If companies don’t follow the rule, they could face big fines or even jail time. Some worry this might make Singapore less attractive for crypto businesses, and companies might leave or change how they work. The goal is to keep Singapore’s financial system safe and trusted, even if it slows down crypto growth.

In 2025, the U.K. is reigniting its nuclear energy ambitions, driven by Labour peer **Philip Hunt**’s vision to secure economic growth and combat climate change. This revival, spurred by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**’s clean energy pledge, aims to bolster energy security and create jobs through investments in small modular reactors and projects like Sizewell C. By prioritizing nuclear power, the U.K. seeks to lead in sustainable innovation, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and meet net-zero targets. This bold shift promises to reshape the nation’s energy landscape, drive industrial growth, and position the U.K. as a global clean energy powerhouse.

On June 7, 2025, **Geely** Chairman **Li Shufu** warned of "serious overcapacity" in the global auto industry at a Chongqing forum. Geely, which owns **Volvo** and **Zeekr**, will halt new plant construction and production expansion due to a fierce price war in China, the world’s largest auto market. Chinese automakers like **BYD** and **Chery** are seeking overseas markets amid domestic oversupply. Geely plans to use **Renault**’s Brazilian facilities, though regulatory delays persist. This reflects broader industry challenges, with excess production capacity pushing firms to rethink strategies in a competitive, tariff-heavy global landscape.

A _**Biology Letters**_ study reveals Goffin’s cockatoos in **Sydney**, **Australia**, display remarkable problem-solving by using their beaks and claws to drink from public fountains. **University of Vienna** researchers tested eight cockatoos with a water-filled tube, inaccessible for direct sipping. All succeeded: four used beaks to dip objects like wood or straw to draw water, while four used claws to scoop it. This flexibility, observed in Sydney’s urban fountains, extends their known tool-use skills from food to water access, rivaling primate cognition. The findings highlight cockatoos’ adaptive intelligence in creatively solving environmental challenges in urban settings.
