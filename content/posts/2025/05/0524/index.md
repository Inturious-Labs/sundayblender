At Google I/O 2025, held in Mountain View, the company showcased its deepening commitment to artificial intelligence. Central to the event was the introduction of **Gemini 2.5**, an advanced AI model featuring "Deep Think" for complex reasoning tasks. Google Search debuted "AI Mode," offering conversational, multimodal responses. Creative tools like Veo 3 and Imagen 4 enable realistic video and image generation from text prompts. Project Astra was unveiled as a universal AI assistant, while Android XR introduced smart glasses with real-time translation and AI overlays.

Chinese commercial space firm **Laser Starcom** set a new benchmark in orbital communications by achieving a **400 Gbps** laser data link between two low Earth orbit satellites, Guangchuan-01 and Guangchuan-02. Separated by **640 kilometers**, the satellites transmitted **14.4 terabytes** of data in under **seven** **minutes** with remarkable precision, all while traveling at **28,000 km/h**. It’s 4x faster than **Starlink (**owned by **SpaceX)**’s **100 Gbps** optical links.

**OpenAI** acquired **io**, an AI hardware startup founded by former **Apple** design chief **Jony Ive**, in a **$6.4 billion** all-stock deal. The acquisition brings together Ive's design expertise and OpenAI's AI capabilities to develop innovative consumer devices. Approximately **55** employees from io will join OpenAI, while Ive's design firm, **LoveFrom**, will oversee design across OpenAI's software and hardware products. This strategic move positions OpenAI to expand beyond software, aiming to create AI-integrated hardware that redefines user interaction.

**China Huaneng Group** officially deployed the world’s largest fleet of autonomous electric mining trucks at the Yimin open-pit mine in **Inner Mongolia**. The 100-truck fleet, branded “Huaneng Ruichi,” includes **90-ton** vehicles with no driver’s cabins. Powered by **Huawei**’s 5G-A communications, AI sensing, and cloud coordination technologies, the trucks operate fully autonomously, even in extreme temperatures as low as **\-40°C**. With efficiency surpassing human-operated vehicles by **120%**, the fleet marks a major leap toward zero-carbon, safer, and more intelligent mining.

**Google**'s **Veo 3** AI video tool, launched at I/O 2025, is flooding the internet with hyperrealistic clips, blurring the line between real and fake. Unlike **OpenAI**’s **Sora**, Veo 3 generates dialogue, soundtracks, and lifelike visuals with accurate physics and lip-syncing. Available to Google AI Ultra subscribers, it powers **Flow**, a filmmaking tool enabling cinematic clips from text prompts. Viral examples, like fake **Fortnite** gameplay and AI actors railing against creators, showcase its prowess, sparking awe and concern. While empowering filmmakers, Veo 3 raises fears of disinformation, though Google’s **SynthID** watermark aims to curb misuse.

**Anthropic**'s **Claude Opus 4** has surpassed **OpenAI**'s **GPT-4.1,** achieving a record-breaking **72.5%** SWE-Bench score and coding autonomously for **seven hours**, redefining AI's role in enterprise.

Scientists at **Colossal Biosciences** have created three wolf pups—Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi—that carry DNA from the extinct dire wolf, famous from **Game of Thrones** as the fierce companions of the **Stark** family. Using ancient DNA from **13,000-** and **72,000**\-year-old fossils, they edited gray wolf genes to give these pups dire wolf traits like white fur and bigger bodies. Kept in a secret **2,000-acre** U.S. preserve, they’re not pure dire wolves but hybrids. Critics say it’s more about hype than true revival, but it could help save endangered wolves.
