Scientists at **Colossal Biosciences** have created three wolf pups—Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi—that carry DNA from the extinct dire wolf, famous from **Game of Thrones** as the fierce companions of the **Stark** family. Using ancient DNA from **13,000-** and **72,000**\-year-old fossils, they edited gray wolf genes to give these pups dire wolf traits like white fur and bigger bodies. Kept in a secret **2,000-acre** U.S. preserve, they’re not pure dire wolves but hybrids. Critics say it’s more about hype than true revival, but it could help save endangered wolves.
