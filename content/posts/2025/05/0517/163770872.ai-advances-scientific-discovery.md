China's defense industry is experiencing a transformative moment akin to the **DeepSeek** AI breakthrough. Recent reports highlight China's **J-10C** fighter jets' success in combat scenarios, notably in the **India-Pakistan** conflict, where Pakistan claimed to have downed multiple Indian aircraft using these Chinese-made jets. This development has prompted investors to reassess China's military capabilities and its potential to emerge as a significant arms exporter. The success of Chinese defense technology is challenging the traditional dominance of Western military suppliers and may reshape global defense dynamics.

**OpenAI** is collaborating with the **United Arab Emirates** to develop a massive **5-gigawatt** data center campus in **Abu Dhabi**, potentially one of the world's largest. This initiative is part of OpenAI's "**Stargate**" project, aiming to expand AI infrastructure globally. The project is led by Emirati AI firm **G42**, with support from U.S. tech giants like **Microsoft**, **Nvidia**, and **Cisco**. The data center will span approximately 1**0 square miles** and consume power equivalent to five nuclear reactors. This development aligns with a broader U.S.-UAE agreement to establish the largest AI campus outside the U.S., reflecting the UAE's ambition to become a global AI hub.

​On May 12, 2025, US President **Donald Trump** signed Executive Order 14297 to cut U.S. prescription drug prices by up to **90%**, using a “most-favored-nation” pricing strategy—matching the lowest prices paid in developed countries. The order requires pharmaceutical companies to comply within 30 days, targeting Medicare, Medicaid, and private markets. Trump cited a friend’s comparison of U.S. and U.K. prices as inspiration. The move sparked backlash in Europe and legal concerns over trade and regulatory feasibility. Critics warn it may disrupt innovation, while Trump framed it as a bold step to make medicine more affordable for Americans facing high healthcare costs.

In 2025, the United States is grappling with its most severe measles outbreak in decades, recording over **1,000** cases across **31 states**. **Texas** has been the hardest hit, with **718** cases, particularly concentrated in **Gaines County**. Health experts warn that declining vaccination rates, fueled by misinformation, threaten to reverse progress made since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) emphasizes the critical need for increased **MMR** vaccination coverage to prevent measles from becoming endemic again.

On May 16, 2025, **Moody’s** downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating from **Aaa** to **Aa1**, citing escalating federal debt, rising interest costs, and persistent political gridlock. This marks the first time since **1919** that Moody’s has removed its top-tier rating for the U.S., following similar actions by **S&P** in 2011 and **Fitch** in 2023. Moody’s projects the national debt could reach **134%** of GDP by **2035**, fueled by ongoing deficits and potential extensions of Trump-era tax cuts.

Scientists have uncovered amber deposits on the seafloor near Japan's **Hokkaido Island** that may provide evidence of a massive tsunami occurring approximately **115 million** years ago. This amber, fossilized tree resin, was found within marine sediment layers, suggesting it was swept into the ocean by a powerful wave event. The amber exhibits unique deformation patterns, such as flame structures and flattened bands, indicating it was still soft when transported and rapidly buried. These findings offer a rare glimpse into ancient tsunami activity and its impact on prehistoric coastal forests.

Paleontologists have uncovered a remarkable **506-million**\-year-old predator named _**Mosura** **fentoni**_ in Canada. This tiny, moth-like arthropod, approximately the size of a human index finger, exhibits unique features that set it apart from other Cambrian-era creatures. Notably, it possessed three eyes, spiny jointed claws, a circular mouth lined with teeth, and a body equipped with swimming flaps along its sides. The discovery of _Mosura fentoni_ provides valuable insights into the diversity and complexity of early arthropods during the **Cambrian** period, when most major animal groups first appeared during what is called the **Cambrian Explosion**.

Researchers at **UC San Diego** have uncovered that the **PHGDH** gene, previously identified as a biomarker for **Alzheimer's** disease, actually contributes to its onset. Using artificial intelligence (AI), the team discovered that PHGDH activates a pathway disrupting gene regulation in brain cells, leading to Alzheimer's development. This "moonlighting" role was revealed through AI-assisted 3D structural analysis. Additionally, the AI-guided compound **NCT-503** was found to inhibit this pathogenic activity, offering a potential therapeutic avenue. Around **30-50%** of people aged **85** and older in the US may develop Alzheimer’s.

Texas is currently experiencing an unprecedented early-season heat wave, with temperatures soaring into the upper 90s and heat index values exceeding **100°F** in cities like **Houston**, **Austin**, and **San Antonio**. This extreme heat, more typical of August than May, is attributed to a strong high-pressure system over the Gulf of Mexico. Houston is on track for one of its warmest Mays since records began in **1889**, with average highs placing it in the top 10% of warmest Mays. San Antonio faces worsening drought conditions, having recorded only **0.19 inches** of rainfall this month compared to the average **4.4 inches**.

**Axial Seamount**, an underwater volcano located approximately **300 miles** off **Oregon**'s coast, is exhibiting signs of an impending eruption—the first since 2015. Scientists monitoring the seamount have recorded over **1,000** daily earthquakes in late March and early April 2025, indicating magma movement beneath the seafloor. The volcano's inflation has reached nearly **90%** of its pre-2015 eruption level. While the eruption poses no threat to human populations due to its depth and distance from shore, it offers researchers a unique opportunity to study volcanic processes and their impact on deep-sea ecosystems in real time.

**Percival Everett**'s novel _**James**_ won the **2025 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction**, offering a profound reimagining of **Mark Twain**’s _**Adventures of Huckleberry Finn**_. Told from the perspective of Jim, the enslaved character who accompanies Huck on his journey down the Mississippi River, the novel shifts the focus to explore Jim's internal world, giving him a much deeper, more complex voice than in Twain’s original. Jim becomes the protagonist of his own story, grappling with his experiences of enslavement, freedom, and race. The novel has garnered widespread acclaim, including the **National Book Award** and the **Kirkus Prize**, and has been recognized as one of the best books of 2024 by various publications.
