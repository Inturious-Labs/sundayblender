Widely considered the largest auto show in the world, the **2025 Shanghai Auto Show** highlighted significant shifts in the global automotive landscape. Chinese automakers, including **BYD**, **Chery**, and **Leapmotor**, showcased advanced electric vehicles (EVs), emphasizing rapid innovation and domestic market dominance. BYD introduced ultra-fast charging systems and plans for expansive charging infrastructure across China. However, rising U.S. and EU tariffs pose challenges for global expansion, prompting manufacturers to adapt by localizing production in markets like Vietnam and Latin America. Additionally, following a fatal accident involving **Xiaomi**'s SU7 EV, Chinese regulators urged automakers to temper claims about autonomous driving capabilities, focusing on safety and responsible marketing.

**Apple** has partnered with **Anthropic** to integrate the **Claude Sonnet** AI model into an enhanced version of its **Xcode** development platform. This collaboration introduces a "**vibe-coding**" approach, where AI assists in writing, editing, and testing code. The updated Xcode features a chat interface, enabling developers to request code snippets, perform UI testing, and identify bugs. Currently, the tool is being rolled out internally at Apple, with no confirmed plans for a public release. This move reflects Apple's strategy to leverage external AI expertise, complementing its existing AI initiatives and addressing previous challenges with in-house tools like Swift Assist.

**JetZero**, a California-based aerospace startup, is developing the **Z4**, the world’s first **blended-wing-body (BWB)** passenger aircraft.

This innovative design aims to reduce drag and increase lift, allowing for up to **50%** lower fuel consumption compared to conventional aircraft. The Z4 is designed to carry **250** passengers in a spacious cabin, offering a "living room in the sky" experience. **United Airlines** has expressed interest in purchasing up to **200 units**. JetZero plans to conduct its first full-scale test flight by **late 2027**, with commercial service anticipated by **2030**.

On April 28, 2025, **Spain** and **Portugal** experienced their most severe power outage in history, affecting nearly **60 million** people. The blackout began around 12:30 PM local time when Spain's grid lost approximately **15 gigawatts** of electricity—about **60%** of its demand—in just **five seconds**. Initial reports suggest that two significant power generation losses, possibly from solar plants in southwestern Spain, led to grid instability and a breakdown in the interconnection with France. The outage halted public transportation, including subways and trains, and disrupted phone and internet services across both countries. Hospitals, airports, and ATMs were also affected, leaving thousands stranded and causing widespread chaos. Power was gradually restored, with over **90%** of Spain's electricity supply back online by early Tuesday morning. Authorities have ruled out cyberattacks and are continuing investigations to determine the exact cause.

On May 3, 2025, Singaporeans cast their votes in a general election that served as a significant test for the ruling **People's Action Party (PAP)** amid rising living costs and global economic uncertainties. Prime Minister **Lawrence Wong**, who succeeded **Lee Hsien Loong** in 2024, led the PAP's campaign, emphasizing the need for stable governance to navigate challenges such as U.S.-China trade tensions and inflation. The opposition, particularly the **Workers' Party**, sought to expand their parliamentary presence, advocating for greater political diversity and addressing issues like housing affordability and income inequality. Preliminary results indicated that the PAP secured all but one of the **15** contested constituencies, maintaining its long-standing dominance .

Starting May 7, 2025, the U.S. will enforce the **REAL ID Act**, requiring travelers aged 18 and older to present a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or an alternative acceptable form of identification—such as a valid passport—at TSA checkpoints for domestic flights and when accessing certain federal facilities. Previously, a standard state-issued driver’s license sufficed for these purposes. However, in response to the 9/11 attacks, the REAL ID Act was enacted in 2005 to enhance security standards for identification, aiming to prevent identity fraud and terrorism. A REAL ID-compliant license is typically marked with a star in the upper-right corner. If a traveler’s current ID lacks this designation, he/she can use a passport or another approved ID for travel.

European Commission **President Ursula von der Leyen** has extended an invitation to scientists and researchers worldwide to establish themselves in Europe. Addressing the European People's Party Congress in **Valencia**, she emphasized Europe's commitment to freedom of science and open academic debate, contrasting it with the current climate in the United States under **President Trump**'s administration. Von der Leyen highlighted that recent funding cuts and policy shifts in the U.S. have created an environment of uncertainty, prompting many researchers to seek more stable and supportive settings for their work. In response, European institutions are enhancing support for international talent, including increased funding and streamlined relocation processes.

**Tesla**'s European sales have significantly declined, with **April 2025** marking the fourth consecutive month of downturns.Notably, **Sweden** experienced an **81%** drop, while the **Netherlands** and **Denmark** saw reductions of **74%** and **67%**, respectively. In **France**, sales fell by **59%**, and in **Germany**, they plummeted by **62%** during the first quarter. These declines contrast with a **28%** increase in overall electric vehicle (EV) sales across Europe, highlighting Tesla's underperformance. Contributing factors include intensified competition from Chinese EV manufacturers like **BYD**, **Chery**, and **SAIC**, as well as Tesla's aging vehicle lineup. Additionally, CEO **Elon Musk**'s political affiliations and role in the Trump administration have led to protests and vandalism of Tesla properties, further damaging the brand's reputation.

**China**'s May Day holiday, spanning from **May 1 to May 5, 2025**, has witnessed a significant surge in travel, marking a post-pandemic peak. On May 1 alone, inter-regional passenger trips reached **332.7 million**, a **6.2%** increase from the previous year, with road travel comprising the majority of these journeys. Railway travel also saw a record high, handling **23.12 million** passengers, an **11.7%** rise year-on-year. Air travel experienced an **8.9%** increase, with **2.34 million** passengers on May 1. This surge is attributed to favorable spring weather, the easing of pandemic restrictions, and a growing interest in both domestic and international tourism. Notably, outbound travel orders soared by over **130%**, with destinations like **Japan**, **South Korea**, and **Southeast Asia** leading the demand.

On May 2, 2025, **President Donald Trump** ended the U.S. "**de minimis**" exemption for low-value imports from **China** and **Hong Kong**, which had allowed shipments under **$800** to enter duty-free. This move, part of a broader trade strategy, imposes tariffs up to **145%** on such imports, aiming to curb illicit goods and unfair competition from e-commerce platforms like **Shein** and **Temu**. The policy shift has led to increased prices for consumers, disrupted supply chains, and forced companies to adjust their business models, potentially impacting the broader US economy.

Years ago, scientists found that certain kinds of bacteria appear to breathe by generating electricity, rather than taking in oxygen, but how they did so was a mystery. A new study published in the journal _**Cell**_ identifies how this happens: the microbes are using a group of chemicals called **naphthoquinones** in a manner similar to the way a battery discharges electricity. This is what enables bacteria to thrive in oxygen-deprived areas like deep sea vents. Armed with this knowledge, it may be possible for scientists to adapt these bacteria for use in a wide variety of applications, such as wastewater treatment or developing bioelectronic sensors. It could even be used as a method to turn atmospheric carbon dioxide into useful chemicals–a sustainability twofer.

## Nature & Environment

A devastating wildfire on the **Isle of Arran, Scotland**, destroyed approximately **27,000** trees, including rare whitebeams endemic to the island. The blaze, which occurred from April 10 to 13 in the **Glen Rosa valley**, also claimed the lives of hundreds of reptiles and amphibians, such as adders, slow worms, and frogs. Kate Sampson, a **National Trust for Scotland** ranger, described the loss as a decade of conservation efforts going up in flames. The fire, likely ignited by a discarded _glass bottle_ reflecting sunlight, underscores the escalating wildfire risks due to drier, warmer springs in Scotland.

This decision has led to a near **7%** drop in **Take-Two Interactive**'s stock price, Rockstar's parent company. The game, set in a fictional version of South Florida inspired by Miami, has generated substantial excitement since a trailer debuted in December 2023. While fans are disappointed by the delay, many appreciate Rockstar's commitment to delivering a polished experience.
