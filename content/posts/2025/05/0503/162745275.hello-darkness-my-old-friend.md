Widely considered the largest auto show in the world, the **2025 Shanghai Auto Show** highlighted significant shifts in the global automotive landscape. Chinese automakers, including **BYD**, **Chery**, and **Leapmotor**, showcased advanced electric vehicles (EVs), emphasizing rapid innovation and domestic market dominance. BYD introduced ultra-fast charging systems and plans for expansive charging infrastructure across China. However, rising U.S. and EU tariffs pose challenges for global expansion, prompting manufacturers to adapt by localizing production in markets like Vietnam and Latin America. Additionally, following a fatal accident involving **Xiaomi**'s SU7 EV, Chinese regulators urged automakers to temper claims about autonomous driving capabilities, focusing on safety and responsible marketing.

On April 28, 2025, **Spain** and **Portugal** experienced their most severe power outage in history, affecting nearly **60 million** people. The blackout began around 12:30 PM local time when Spain's grid lost approximately **15 gigawatts** of electricity—about **60%** of its demand—in just **five seconds**. Initial reports suggest that two significant power generation losses, possibly from solar plants in southwestern Spain, led to grid instability and a breakdown in the interconnection with France. The outage halted public transportation, including subways and trains, and disrupted phone and internet services across both countries. Hospitals, airports, and ATMs were also affected, leaving thousands stranded and causing widespread chaos. Power was gradually restored, with over **90%** of Spain's electricity supply back online by early Tuesday morning. Authorities have ruled out cyberattacks and are continuing investigations to determine the exact cause.

On May 3, 2025, Singaporeans cast their votes in a general election that served as a significant test for the ruling **People's Action Party (PAP)** amid rising living costs and global economic uncertainties. Prime Minister **Lawrence Wong**, who succeeded **Lee Hsien Loong** in 2024, led the PAP's campaign, emphasizing the need for stable governance to navigate challenges such as U.S.-China trade tensions and inflation. The opposition, particularly the **Workers' Party**, sought to expand their parliamentary presence, advocating for greater political diversity and addressing issues like housing affordability and income inequality. Preliminary results indicated that the PAP secured all but one of the **15** contested constituencies, maintaining its long-standing dominance .

Starting May 7, 2025, the U.S. will enforce the **REAL ID Act**, requiring travelers aged 18 and older to present a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or an alternative acceptable form of identification—such as a valid passport—at TSA checkpoints for domestic flights and when accessing certain federal facilities. Previously, a standard state-issued driver’s license sufficed for these purposes. However, in response to the 9/11 attacks, the REAL ID Act was enacted in 2005 to enhance security standards for identification, aiming to prevent identity fraud and terrorism. A REAL ID-compliant license is typically marked with a star in the upper-right corner. If a traveler’s current ID lacks this designation, he/she can use a passport or another approved ID for travel.

Years ago, scientists found that certain kinds of bacteria appear to breathe by generating electricity, rather than taking in oxygen, but how they did so was a mystery. A new study published in the journal _**Cell**_ identifies how this happens: the microbes are using a group of chemicals called **naphthoquinones** in a manner similar to the way a battery discharges electricity. This is what enables bacteria to thrive in oxygen-deprived areas like deep sea vents. Armed with this knowledge, it may be possible for scientists to adapt these bacteria for use in a wide variety of applications, such as wastewater treatment or developing bioelectronic sensors. It could even be used as a method to turn atmospheric carbon dioxide into useful chemicals–a sustainability twofer.

One of the leading figures of the Romantic movement, British poet **Lord Byron** swam across the **Hellespont** (now the **Dardanelles**) on **May 3, 1810**. The swim became an iconic moment in his life and was inspired by the ancient legend of **Leander**, who swam across the Hellespont to meet his lover, Hero. Byron's swim was celebrated for its audacity and stamina, as he swam the **1.5-mile** stretch between Europe and Asia in about one hour and ten minutes. Known to have a club foot, Byron’s mobility on land was restricted, but in the water, he transformed into a passionate and adept swimmer.

​In **Rockport, Massachusetts**, a pileated **woodpecker** has been wreaking havoc on vehicles, breaking over two dozen side mirrors and at least one window. Residents, amused by the feathered vandal, have resorted to creative solutions like covering mirrors with towels and trash bags. Experts suggest the bird's behavior is linked to mating season, with the woodpecker mistaking its reflection for a rival. Despite the inconvenience, the community has embraced the situation with humor, viewing the woodpecker as a quirky local character rather than a menace.
