On May 28, 2025, researchers at **ETH Zürich** unveiled a groundbreaking achievement: a four-legged robot named **ANYmal-D** that autonomously plays badminton against human opponents. Using reinforcement learning, the robot tracks the shuttlecock’s flight with a stereo camera, predicts its trajectory, and coordinates its movements to return shots. Outfitted with a dynamic arm and racket, ANYmal-D achieved rallies of up to 10 consecutive hits in tests, navigating the court with agility. While not yet a match for pros, this innovation marks a leap in robotic capabilities, blending vision, locomotion, and precision for real-time sports interaction.

In early May 2025, cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered an unsecured Elastic database containing **184 million** user logins, totaling **47 GB** of data, exposed online without any password protection. The leak included credentials for major platforms like **Google**, **Facebook**, **Snapchat**, and even government accounts, all in plain text. Experts believe cybercriminals used info-stealing malware to collect the data, which was removed after discovery, though the owner remains unknown. Some users confirmed their real info was exposed. Recommendations include changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, updating software, and avoiding suspicious links to mitigate risks from this massive breach.

A May 2025 Science News article highlights a genetic study offering hope for the rare saola, an elusive antelope-like species discovered in 1992 in Southeast Asia’s Annamite mountains. The study reveals two saola populations diverged 20,000 to 5,000 years ago due to climate-driven habitat changes. Researchers estimate that a captive breeding program with 12 saolas, mixing these genetic groups, could prevent extinction. The Saola Foundation, led by experts like Rob Timmins, is committed to this effort despite the species’ critically low numbers. Only one living saola has been seen by Western scientists, underscoring the urgency of conservation efforts.

A 2025 study in _Cell_ by Chinese researchers showed that rice exposed to cold could pass on the ability to handle frost to its offspring. Instead of changes in its DNA, the rice used a special trick called DNA methylation—think of it like adding sticky notes to a recipe book to change how it’s read, without rewriting the book. This ability lasted for five generations, similar to an old idea by **Lamarck** that traits learned during life can be passed on. This challenges **Darwin**’s idea that evolution only happens through random DNA changes, showing nature can adapt faster.

**Walt Whitman**, born on **May 31, 1819**, in West Hills, Long Island, New York, emerged as a defining voice in American literature.

Despite initial criticism, Whitman’s work, including his Civil War reflections, left a lasting legacy, cementing his place as a cornerstone of American poetry.

​A new travel trend is catching on among young Chinese tourists: group photos taken on surveillance cameras.

Miraculously, Peng survived, landing after a descent during which he may have briefly lost consciousness. He captured the incident on video, but authorities suspended his flying privileges for six months, deeming the flight unauthorized.
