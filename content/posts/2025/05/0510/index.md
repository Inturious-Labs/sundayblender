The Soviet spacecraft Cosmos 482, launched in 1972 on a failed mission to **Venus**, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere between May 9 and 11, 2025, after **53** years in orbit. Built to withstand Venus's extreme conditions, the **495 kg** lander may survive re-entry, posing a minimal risk due to its uncontrolled descent. The potential impact zone spans between **52°N** and **52°S** latitudes, covering much of the inhabited world. Experts anticipate it will likely fall into the ocean or unpopulated areas, minimizing danger to people, with a projected risk of **0.40** in **10,000**. The exact time and location remain uncertain due to variables like solar activity and the spacecraft's deteriorated state.

In their paper _**The Unbearable Slowness of Being: Why Do We Live at 10 Bits/s?**_, **Caltech** researchers **Jieyu Zheng** and **Markus Meister** reveal that, despite our sensory systems collecting data at approximately **1 gigabit** per second, our conscious thought processes operate at a mere **10 bits** per second. This discrepancy arises because the brain filters vast sensory inputs, allowing only essential information to reach conscious awareness. The authors propose that this "speed limit" is an evolutionary adaptation, enabling efficient decision-making in environments where rapid processing isn't critical. They distinguish between the "outer" brain, handling fast sensory and motor signals, and the "inner" brain, which processes the reduced information needed for behavior. This insight challenges assumptions about enhancing human cognition through technology (such as **Elon Musk**’s **Neuralink**), suggesting inherent biological constraints on our processing speed.

In April and May 2025, **NASA** launched two super-pressure balloons from **Wānaka Airport, New Zealand**, as part of a campaign to test long-duration, high-altitude flight technology. The first balloon, carrying the HIWIND payload to study thermospheric winds, achieved a full circumnavigation of the Southern Hemisphere in 16 days. However, due to a suspected leak causing altitude instability, the mission was safely terminated after 17 days over the Pacific Ocean. The second balloon lifted off on May 3 and reached a float altitude of **108,000 feet**, aiming for a **100-day** flight to further validate the technology and support additional scientific experiments.
