On May 9, 2025, **SpaceX** successfully launched **26** Starlink satellites aboard a **Falcon 9** rocket from **Vandenberg Space Force Base** in **California**. The mission, designated Starlink 15-3, lifted off at 5:19 p.m. PDT (8:19 p.m. EDT) after several delays earlier in the week. The first-stage booster, B1081, completed its **14th** flight and landed on the droneship _**Of Course I Still Love You**_ in the Pacific Ocean approximately eight minutes after liftoff. This marked the **441st** booster landing and the **128th** on that particular vessel. The satellites will join the Starlink constellation, enhancing global broadband coverage and bringing the total satellites to **8,542**.

The Soviet spacecraft Cosmos 482, launched in 1972 on a failed mission to **Venus**, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere between May 9 and 11, 2025, after **53** years in orbit. Built to withstand Venus's extreme conditions, the **495 kg** lander may survive re-entry, posing a minimal risk due to its uncontrolled descent. The potential impact zone spans between **52°N** and **52°S** latitudes, covering much of the inhabited world. Experts anticipate it will likely fall into the ocean or unpopulated areas, minimizing danger to people, with a projected risk of **0.40** in **10,000**. The exact time and location remain uncertain due to variables like solar activity and the spacecraft's deteriorated state.

In their paper _**The Unbearable Slowness of Being: Why Do We Live at 10 Bits/s?**_, **Caltech** researchers **Jieyu Zheng** and **Markus Meister** reveal that, despite our sensory systems collecting data at approximately **1 gigabit** per second, our conscious thought processes operate at a mere **10 bits** per second. This discrepancy arises because the brain filters vast sensory inputs, allowing only essential information to reach conscious awareness. The authors propose that this "speed limit" is an evolutionary adaptation, enabling efficient decision-making in environments where rapid processing isn't critical. They distinguish between the "outer" brain, handling fast sensory and motor signals, and the "inner" brain, which processes the reduced information needed for behavior. This insight challenges assumptions about enhancing human cognition through technology (such as **Elon Musk**’s **Neuralink**), suggesting inherent biological constraints on our processing speed.

In April and May 2025, **NASA** launched two super-pressure balloons from **Wānaka Airport, New Zealand**, as part of a campaign to test long-duration, high-altitude flight technology. The first balloon, carrying the HIWIND payload to study thermospheric winds, achieved a full circumnavigation of the Southern Hemisphere in 16 days. However, due to a suspected leak causing altitude instability, the mission was safely terminated after 17 days over the Pacific Ocean. The second balloon lifted off on May 3 and reached a float altitude of **108,000 feet**, aiming for a **100-day** flight to further validate the technology and support additional scientific experiments.

After more than a century of restricted access, the **Octagon Earthworks** in **Newark, Ohio, USA** —a **2,000-year**\-old ceremonial site built by the **Hopewell** culture—officially opened to the public on January 1, 2025. This monumental site, featuring a **50-acre** octagon and a **20-acre** circle, served as a gathering place for thousands of indigenous people for celestial observations and religious ceremonies. Recognized as part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, Ohio's first **UNESCO World Heritage Site**, the Octagon's opening follows a prolonged legal effort to reclaim the land from a private country club. Plans are underway to enhance the site with an interpretive center, honoring its historical and cultural significance.

Scientists predict that the **Northern Lights** will intensify over the next 50 years due to the sun entering a prolonged phase of heightened activity. This period, known as a "**grand solar maximum**," could lead to more frequent and vivid auroral displays, visible at lower latitudes than usual. The increased solar activity may also impact satellite operations and power grids on Earth. This forecast suggests that the spectacular auroras observed in recent years could become a regular occurrence, offering extended opportunities for observation and study.

In response to the surge in remote workers occupying coffee shops for extended periods, some U.S. cafés are eliminating or limiting Wi-Fi and laptop usage. This move aims to reduce overcrowding, preserve a sense of community, and boost turnover rates by preventing patrons from monopolizing tables for hours on video calls. Strategies vary: **New York**'s Devoción restricts weekday Wi-Fi to two hours, **Detroit**'s Alba café has enforced a no-Wi-Fi policy since 2023, and D.C.'s **Elle** café offers limited internet access after initial resistance. While these measures face challenges, such as negative online reviews, they have also fostered increased face-to-face interactions among customers.
