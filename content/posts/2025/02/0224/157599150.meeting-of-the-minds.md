Scientists have discovered a nearly complete skull of a **30-million-year-old** apex predator, Bastetodon syrtos, in Egypt's Fayum Depression. This leopard-sized carnivore belonged to the extinct hyaenodont group and was characterized by sharp teeth and powerful jaw muscles. It thrived in ancient forests that are now deserts, preying on early primates, hippos, elephants, and hyraxes. The find sheds light on Africa's ancient ecosystems before modern carnivores emerged. Named after the Egyptian goddess Bastet, this discovery provides insights into how these formidable predators adapted to climate changes before their eventual extinction about **25 million** years ago.

In Munich, Germany, over **1,000** QR code stickers mysteriously appeared on gravestones and wooden crosses across three cemeteries. The stickers displayed a QR code that revealed the name of the deceased and their grave location when scanned. Initially puzzling authorities, it was later discovered that a local gardening firm had placed them as part of an internal tracking system for maintenance tasks. The removal process caused some damage to the gravestones, prompting a police investigation into property damage. Despite this explanation, many questions remain about how such an extensive operation went unnoticed initially.
