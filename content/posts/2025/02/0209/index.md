**OpenAI**'s Stargate Project is actively evaluating multiple U.S. states for new data center locations. Beyond the flagship site in Abilene, Texas, the company is considering sites in Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Other potential locations include Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia. Each data center is expected to have a capacity of approximately 1 gigawatt, comparable to the output of a nuclear reactor. Key factors in site selection include proximity to power and water resources, future expansion potential, and logistical considerations for large-scale construction.

**France** and the **United Arab Emirates** have agreed to develop a 1-gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence, representing an investment between $30 billion and $50 billion. This initiative aims to strengthen the AI value chain through collaborative projects and investments, including the acquisition of advanced chips, development of data centers, and talent cultivation.

**Apple** has revealed a prototype of a robotic table lamp called ELEGNT, showcasing a potential direction for consumer robotics. Unlike purely functional robots, ELEGNT incorporates expressive qualities like intention, attention, and emotion into its movements. The lamp uses a multi-axial robotic limb to interact with users through gestures and postures, adapting to user movements and conveying a sense of emotion. Apple's research suggests that expression-driven movements enhance user engagement.

In February 2025, California Senator Steve Padilla introduced a bill aimed at safeguarding children from the potentially harmful effects of AI chatbots.

Japan is experiencing its largest influenza outbreak in 25 years, with 9.5 million cases recorded between September 2024, and January 2025 . The surge is attributed to increased holiday travel and reduced flu exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. This outbreak has strained the healthcare system, leading to shortages of antiviral medications like Tamiflu and some hospitals refusing to admit patients who are not in serious condition. The outbreak is mainly caused by influenza A, though there is still a risk of influenza B. Health officials recommend vaccinations and masks to prevent the virus's spread.

Gwadar, a coastal city in Pakistan, faces increasing climate change challenges. Extreme weather, including heavy rainfall, has caused devastating floods, destroying infrastructure and isolating the city. Rising sea levels and warming ocean temperatures lead to more forceful waves and coastal erosion, washing away homes and altering tidal patterns. The lack of proper drainage systems exacerbates flooding. Experts warn that if these issues are not addressed, Gwadar may become uninhabitable.

Santorini, Greece, declared a state of emergency after experiencing a series of undersea earthquakes since late January.

The seismic activity, described as an "earthquake swarm," is unusual due to its intensity and lack of a mainshock. Experts are unsure how long it will last, with some suggesting the biggest quake may be yet to come.
